# Youtube App that allows you to watch videos with no ads, download videos, and save videos to playlists.

 How to use - Download this .ipa and get cydia impactor. Open cydia impactor and enter your itunes login, and
 the app will start to install on your device. (Needs to be re codesigned every 7 days by cydia impactor)

 additional configurations - have an ipastore.me app installed on your device, and iFunBox. Connect your iDevice 
 to your computer and open iFunBox. Go to Filesharing pane and click on iPASTORE. Copy from Mac the .ipa that you downloaded
 from this repo and import it into iPASTORE. Open iPASTORE on your iDevice and go to imports, you will see the .ipa in there.
 click on the .ipa and it will install on your device. ( Up to one year of app being codesigned and non revoked by Apple )

 When you install this app, there will still be Ads, you need to install a tweak from cydia called localiapstore.
 Go to settings and make sure Localiapstore is on. Now make sure youtube unlimit app is not in your switcher running in the background. Now open youtube unlimit and go to the tab all the way to the right of the screen and go to subscription. 
 The option to buy premium to get rid of ads will be available. click on buy premium and then when the enter iTunes Login appears, click canel and Localiapstore will spoof the purchase and give you premium.
 I would then kill the app and make sure it is not running in the background. Relaunch app and you will have no ads now.
